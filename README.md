# sessions control for hammerspoon
A script for hammerspoon(Mac) that can switch among sessions

# Description
Use a set of hotkeys to control some sessions which is a set of windows.

You can easily minimize all windows of a session, and unminimize the another one.
We will also save the full screen status, will set window full screen if it was.

For now, we only minimize the windows, and will update to hide the windows not in work.


# ToDo:
* Detect if there is a save file, if not create a default
* Add a new session
* delete a session
* jump to a session easily
* show windows in current session

# MayBe:
* Change session to a table like

	{{win, isFull}, {...}, name=name_of_session}

	and use ipairs to find window

* Hide windows not in work
